A coding write effect, inspired by Kevin Powell, only using CSS.

explaining the variables:

The --typewriterSpeed is the speed of the animation, you can set as many seconds as you wan;
The --typewriterSteps is the amount of the caracteres in the first text, the "function wellcome()". If you want to add more carachteres you have to increase this number, if you want to remove some carachteres you have to decrease this number. The spaces are counting like carachteres too;
The  --typewriterDelay is the time that the second text will show up, if you change the --typewriterSpeed you have to change this variable too.
